# Backend
The backend is the unseen side of a website or application. It's essentially the engine that powers everything you see and interact with on the frontend (the user interface).

Here's a breakdown of the backend:

Location:  It resides on a server, which is a powerful computer that stores and processes data.

Functionality: Handles all the complex operations that make the website or app function. This includes:

Storing data in databases
Processing user requests
Running server-side logic
Communicating with APIs (application programming interfaces)
Ensuring security and performance
Analogy: Think of a restaurant. The frontend is the dining area and menu (what you see), while the backend is the kitchen (where the cooking and prep work happen).
